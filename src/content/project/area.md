AREA is a task automation software (like Zapier, Make, or IFTTT) that allows you to chain an Action to a REAction.

I worked alone on the mobile app, which allows you to authenticate to services, link them together, and unlink them. You can give a name and a description to your tasks. It support PKCE for maximum security.
The app is available in English and French. It also has a white and dark mode, as well as a skeleton loading state.

I started from scratch and it took me about a month to finish it.
