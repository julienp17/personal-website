Arcade is a simulation of an arcade that allows you to switch between games and displays of your liking in real-time. It is also possible to contribute and add more content thanks to its plugin system.

You can choose directly from the menu which display you would like to see, whether its text mode with Ncurses, or graphic
mode with SDL2. Or once you have launched a game, you can press shortcut keys to switch between different games, or the
different displays available. Since this is an arcade, try to get the highest score possible while competing with other players!

This project seeks to teach the separation between the display logic and the game logic.
I was in charge of creating the displays libraries, aswell as the Core which serves as the bridge of communication
between the display and the games.
