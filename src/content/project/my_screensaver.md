my_screensaver is the first graphical project at Epitech.

A screensaver is a computer program that can be set to turn on after a period of user inactivity.
It is used to display cool graphical effects and animations while the user is away.

These animations were made by only using basic shapes and accessing the screen's framebuffer directly.
I made around 15 different animations, with inspiration from the Coding Train, a youtube channel that teaches coding for everyone!
