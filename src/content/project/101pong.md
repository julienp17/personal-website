101Pong is the first mathematical project at Epitech.

The goal is to imagine a 3D version of Pong, and calculate the ball's velocity,
coordinates, and angle at which it will hit the paddle given its abscissa, ordinate, and altitude
at a given time 't-1' and 't', aswell as a given time shift 'n'.

As a bonus, I made the actual game with Python and the Pygame library.
