Tetris is the one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time.

In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field.
The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces.
The game ends when the playing field is filled.

This is a terminal version of this game in text-mode, using the Ncurses library.
