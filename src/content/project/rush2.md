Rush2 is a project made in 24 hours as part of Epitech's C pool.

It is a command-line tool that tries to guess in which language a text is written in.
It can guess only between English, French, German, and Spanish, but additional languages can easily be integrated.

It uses a letter frequencies CSV file. Thus, a longer text provides better results.
