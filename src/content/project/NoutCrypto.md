Noutcrypto is a website made for the 2021 edition of the WEBCUP.
The WEBCUP is a hackaton in which you have to make a website in 24 hours while competing with other groups from Reunion Island.

NoutCrypto offers the possibility to the Reunion Island citizens of investing in made-up cryptocurrency farms
all over the territory. These cryptofarms offer to invest in their construction in exchange for a percentage
of cryptocurrency they will produce. This fictional cryptocurrency is called 'DodoCoin', referencing
the extinct Dodo bird that was once endemic to the island of Mauritius.

I was in charge of the backend and deployment of this website, working with Express and Nginx.
I worked with two fellow Epitech students: Tristan BOURGEOIS for the front-end with Vue, and Dorian BEASSE for the assets with Photoshop.
