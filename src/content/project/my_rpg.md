my_rpg is the final and biggest graphical project of the first year at Epitech.
The goal is to create a playable action RPG game.

As you can see, it is heavily inspired by the infamous Earthbound SNES game.
You can move around the big main map, change maps, and talk to NPCS (non-playable characters).
It is highly customizable : the maps are made with Tiled, fonts and songs just need to be placed
in their respective directory, and NPCs and warps are just text files.

I made this project alone in a bit more than 1 month.
While the final product is below my expectations, I'm still proud of my work, especially how I structured
the project with over 5000 lines of code, and during the first corona lockdown.
I spent a lot of time refactoring to make it scalable, but I lacked some more to actually polish the game.
