Cardinal chains is a minimalist puzzle game centering on the concept of non-decreasing sequences.

Each puzzle begins with a monochrome grid of numbers, plus a few colored cells marked with an "X".
Starting at these cells, you must link up numbers in non-decreasing order until the whole grid is filled with color.
This game was made by Daniel Nora and is playable on all platforms.

This project is a terminal version that I made in around 3 hours as part of a challenge.
