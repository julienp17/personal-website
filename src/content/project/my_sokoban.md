Sokoban is a famous puzzle video game from Japan, meaning 'Warehouse guard'.

The game is played on a grid, where each square is a floor or a wall.
Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations.
The player can move a box by walking up to it and push it to the square beyond.
The puzzle is solved when all boxes are placed at storage locations.

This is a terminal version of this game using the Ncurses library.
